# What it is

The idea for pomodomo is a web-based pomodoro-tracker which builds in some light social funtionality and gamification techniques to help make development using the pomodoro technique more fun. And to help us win HacktoberCHS.

I'm too lazy to put a link here to an article on the pomodoro method, but you can copy and paste this into Google if you don't know what it is:

# Features
 - Times individual pomodoros
 - Times breaks between pomodoros (short and long)
 - Asks the user what was accomplished during each pomodoro
 - User can crush pomodoro if he so desires
 - User can configure short and long break lengths
 - User can log in for persistence of data
 - User can form a team with colleagues to compete on team leaderboards (think coderwall)
 - User can similarly compete on weekly or daily individual leaderboards
 - User earns points for each pomo completed
 - User earns badges for that extra shot of dopamine once in a while

# Stack

This is all totally up for debate, of course. 

 - Rails
 - Bootstrap
 - Angular.js?
 - Gravatar?
 - For authentication...devise? I don't care...Omniauth? Nick, you choose >_<
 - Trophies - I plan on germinating another project, a trophy/badge gem, as part of this project.
 - Testing - RSpec, or whatever you guys prefer. A cuke is fine too.
 
Am i missing anything? I'm tired.

# Etc

We can divvy up tasks however you guys want. As for coding, do you think we should use feature branches for our individual features? I reckon its a good idea, but whatever you guys want to do.
